# Power-BI-mini-Project-1
Basic School Sample Mini Project
The school dataset contains inconsistent, incomplete, and unstructured data across various 
f
 ields (e.g., room counts, facilities, staff, student numbers). 
 Many entries have missing values, zeros entered wrongly, or text formatting errors, reducing 
the reliability of the dataset. 
 Duplicate and inaccurate records make it difficult to perform accurate school-level analysis. 
•Column names and data types are not standardized, affecting filtering, sorting, and analysis. 
• Data is not ready for reporting dashboards (e.g., Power BI), limiting meaningful insights for 
decision-making. 
• The dataset requires cleaning, transformation, and validation to ensure accuracy and 
consistency. 
•Lack of defined data rules (such as validation checks, allowed ranges, or consistent formats) 
results in incorrect interpretations. 
 Decision-makers cannot rely on the current raw data to understand school infrastructure, 
staffing, and resource gaps.This project focuses on applying systematic data-cleaning, validation, and transformation 
steps using Excel to convert the raw school dataset into a structured, error-free, and analysis
ready format.
